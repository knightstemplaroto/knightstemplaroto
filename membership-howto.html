			<h1>How to become a member</h1>
		</header>

        <p>Affiliation with O.T.O. is divided into three primary categories: corresponding associates, ecclesiastical lay membership, and initiate membership.</p>

        <p>To be a corresponding associate requires no physical attendance. For a $10.00 annual contribution, corresponding associates have the opportunity to correspond with other O.T.O. members in the U.S.A. and other countries, by mail or via the internet.</p>

        <p>Ecclesiastical lay membership in the <a href="http://oto-usa.org/oto/egc/">Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica</a> (E.G.C.) is conferred by the ceremony of confirmation, which must be preceded by the ceremony of baptism. Lay membership conveys no authority or special privileges within E.G.C. or O.T.O. and may be conferred upon initiates and non-initiates alike.</p>

        <p>Initiate membership can be conferred only in a physical ceremony by a properly chartered initiator. Initiate membership is subdivided by degree. There are a total of 21 Initiate degrees in O.T.O., including thirteen numbered degrees and eight unnumbered, intermediate degrees or sub-degrees.</p>

        <p>If you would like to apply for Minerval Initiation into the O.T.O. through the Knights Templar Oasis, you must be of full age (over 18), free, and of good report across the Order. You must then meet with us to receive an application.</p>
        <p>In order for us to accept your application and schedule you for initiation, you are required to be sponsored by two O.T.O. initiates of the First Degree of higher. Sponsorship is not take lightly, so you must meet and get to know at least a few members of the Oasis.</p>

        <p>Prior to becoming a Minerval you are welcome to attend our public events and workshops, to get to know the character of the organization and its people. While Minerval is a <em>"guest"</em> degree, all earnest Thelemites in accord with O.T.O. are accepted by the Knights Templar as friends. Watch our <a href="calendar.html">calendar</a>, or contact the <a href="secretary@knightstemplar-oto.org">Oasis Secretary</a> if you are interested in attending a public meeting.</p>

        <p>Initiate membership involves a physical ceremony, and thus must typically be arranged with a convenient, local O.T.O. body. A listing of O.T.O. bodies is provided by the U.S. Grand Lodge Homepage at <a href="http://oto-usa.org/locations/">O.T.O. USA Local Bodies</a>.

    <h2>Corresponding Associates</h2>
    <p>Those who live far from any O.T.O. body, or who are not prepared to become O.T.O. members for whatever reason, may support the work of the Order by becoming Corresponding Associates.<p>
    <p>Learn more about corresponding association with O.T.O at the <a href="https://oto-usa.org/oto/membership/">USGL membership page</a>.</p>

    <hr class="major" />
    <h2>Dues & Fees</h2>
    <p>O.T.O. operates primarily on dues and fees collected from the membership. Annual dues are established by the Order as a minimum contribution. Fees (one time only) are set for each initiation to defer the costs of the initiation itself. The annual dues are sent, in their entirety, to Grand Lodge for the general operating fund of the Order.</p>
