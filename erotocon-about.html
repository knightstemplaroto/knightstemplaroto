      <p>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</p>
      <p>We regret to announce that we are forced to postspone the planned Eastern Regional OTO Conference (EROTOCON) due to the current coronavirus pandemic.</p>
      <p>While this is disappointing, we understand that it is the right thing to do in the light of the ongoing health crisis in our country and around the world. We had internally determined that this was a necessary, if not now obvious, course of action, and US Grand Lodge has since indefinitely suspended all gatherings. With multiple states on full lockdown and limitations on gatherings in many others, there is no guarantee that we would even be allowed to hold the event if this epidemic were to diminish quickly â€“ and there is no evidence that it will.</p>
      <p>We appreciate your understanding and wish all of you health, and wealth, and strength, and joy and peace through these difficult times.</p>
      <p>We do not at this time have a reschedule date.</p>
      <p>Love is the law, love under will.</p>
